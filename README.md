Project Description
1. Project Goal/Main Problem to be Solved
Revolutionize car rental in Morocco by eliminating price opacity and building trust through Morocco's first "Name Your Price" marketplace.

KREE aims to revolutionize Morocco’s car rental industry by introducing the first “Name Your Price” marketplace in the country. The platform empowers customers to decide what they are willing to pay for a rental, while allowing partner agencies to bid competitively for their business.

This model:

Restores transparency and trust between travelers and rental agencies.
Offers travelers up to 30% savings on car rentals.
Helps agencies increase their occupancy rate by up to 40%, reducing dependence on high-fee intermediaries.
Creates a win-win ecosystem where pricing fairness and customer satisfaction drive market growth.
KREE’s mission is to become the leading mobility platform in North Africa by 2030, connecting millions of tourists to high-quality, affordable, and transparent transport solutions.

2. Platform's operating method
KREE’s marketplace operates through a reverse auction model based on four simple steps:

Customer Proposes a Price
The traveler enters their rental dates, car category, and the price they are willing to pay.
Agencies Submit Counteroffers
Partner agencies receive the proposal and respond with their best offers.
Customer Selects the Ideal Offer
The traveler reviews the competing bids and chooses the one that best fits their needs.
Secure Payment and Booking
The entire transaction—from payment to contract signing—is handled securely within the KREE app.
Additional integrated systems ensure:
Verified vehicle handover via digital signature and real-time tracking.
Continuous quality evaluation of partners and vehicles.
Automated convoy management for efficient delivery and pick-up logistics.
